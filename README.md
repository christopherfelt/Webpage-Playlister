This project is in progress.

In this project, I am developing a tool that allows a user to upload a music web page and to select the songs from that webpage.  The playlist is then created from the selected songs.


Progress

Feature

Song Selection Tool

- Nearly completed. I need to add a function to my webpage_playlist/views.py file that saves the edited version of the user uploaded webpage. The edited version includes a link to a JS file that contributes to selection process. 

For a demonstration of the selection tool, download all the files in the lab folder. 


Playlist Creator

- The code for this exist in other projects. However, I am not sure how the python-social-auth library interacts with custom user models.
