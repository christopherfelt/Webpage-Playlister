This project is in progress.

In this project, I am developing a tool that allows a user to upload a music web page and to select the songs from that webpage.

Progress

- Nearly completed. I need to add a function to my webpage_playlist/views.py file that saves the edited version of the user uploaded webpage. The edited version includes a link to a JS file that contributes to selection process. 

For a demonstration of the selection tool, download all the files in the lab folder.
